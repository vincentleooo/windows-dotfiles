# Explorer Focus

These scripts are like shortcuts to bring to foreground any Explorer instances. If there are no instances, it will create a new one.

## Usage

Modify `explorer-focus.vbs` such that it points to the ps1 file.

You can then run this in PowerShell or, in my case, to run it via PowerToys Keyboard Manager.

```
wscript "path\to\vbs\explorer-focus.vbs"
```
